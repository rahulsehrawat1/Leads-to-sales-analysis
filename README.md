Data Analysis Project Exploring Lead Conversion Rates And Sales Trends for 2024
# 2024 Sales & Lead Conversion Analytics

This project analyzes a full year of CRM data (January - December 2024) to track how leads move through the sales funnel and which regions or sources provide the highest ROI.

### 📊 Project Overview
I used **Power BI** to transform 24 separate monthly datasets into a single, interactive dashboard. This allows the business to see exactly where sales are growing and where leads are dropping off in real-time.

### 🛠️ What’s Inside?
* **[2024_Sales_Analysis_Report.pdf](Dashboard of imigration sales.pdf):** A full breakdown of my findings and the "Why" behind the data.
* **[Data_Transformation.m](Screenshot 2026-03-01 011242.jpg):** The M-Language code I wrote to automate the data cleaning (ETL) process.
* **Dashboard Screenshots:** Visual proof of the final analysis (see below).

### 📈 Key Insights
* **Funnel Efficiency:** Identified a specific drop-off point in the "Assessment" stage, suggesting a need for faster follow-ups.
* **Top Performers:** Found that Facebook-sourced leads had the highest volume, but Referral leads had a 40% higher conversion rate.
* **Global Trends:** Created a heatmap showing that while lead volume is high in South Asia, the fastest "Lead-to-Sale" time is in the Gulf region (UAE/Kuwait).
